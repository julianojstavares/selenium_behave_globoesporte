# Python + Selenium

# Check on Globo Esporte website who is the 1st place in the Brazilian Championship.

I learned how to do this automation with Selenium + Python following the tutorial by
João Victor Barreto
https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/automatizando-testes-com-python-selenium-e-behave/ (PT-BR)

I had to change just a few lines in the "environment.py" file in order to use
the webdriver-manager https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/

Thank you João!
